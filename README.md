# FastFood Classification

This repository provides access to Jupyter notebooks developed in Google Colab for a FastFood classification project using TensorFlow with pre-trained models ResNet50V2 and InceptionV3. The goal is to classify fast food images into 5 categories including Burger, Donut, HotDog, Pizza, and Sandwich. Reference for this project is from [this Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/utkarshsaxenadn/fast-food-classification-resnet50v2-acc-92/notebook).
